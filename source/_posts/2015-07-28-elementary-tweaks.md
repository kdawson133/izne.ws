## About Elementary Tweaks

![](/images/ElementaryTweaks.png)

Elementary Tweaks is for people who want to customise their desktop. It is made specifically for elementary OS. It lets you change the theme, make modifications in Plank dock and Slingshot application launcher, adjust animation settings, change shadow settings and so on. The original version was made for elementary OS 0.2 Luna, but there’s also a Freya version available. We’ll show you how to use any of that.

To launch Elementary Tweaks (once it’s installed), go to System Settings and then choose Tweaks from the menu.

## Installation on Freya (0.3)
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mpstark/elementary-tweaks-daily

```
## Installation on Luna (0.2)
