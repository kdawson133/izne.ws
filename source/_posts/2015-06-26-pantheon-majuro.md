I was having a look around at a few other Linux distributions like [Ubuntu-Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/), [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [Linux Mint (Debian Edition)](http://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php). I was looking for a distro running some later versions of packages and possibly running Linux Kernel Version 4.

I really like the idea of Arch's rolling release philosophy, but having not mastered Linux to the degree necessary to put together my own custom desktop, I decided to give the Arch based [Manjuro](https://manjaro.github.io/) a whirl. I liked it a lot, but I like the Pantheon DE better. That got me thinking, can't I have my cake and eat it too! It turns out I can. There is a [Manjaro Community Project called Manjaro Pantheon Shell](https://forum.manjaro.org/index.php?topic=22760.0) and they have a [pre-release available](http://sourceforge.net/projects/manjaropantheonshell/).

I think I'll download it and give it a go!! I'll let you know how I get on.
