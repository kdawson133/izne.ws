## Dropbox
[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) provides File syncing to the cloud. I put all my documents in Dropbox. It syncs them to all my devices (laptop, mobile, tablet), and serves as a backup as well! **(Free for 2GB)**

## Google Drive
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/): File syncing to the cloud too! I use Google Docs a lot to collaborate with others (edit a document with multiple people in real-time!), and sometimes upload other non-Google documents (pictures, etc.), so the app comes in handy for that. **(Free for 5GB)**

## Evernote
[Evernote](https://evernote.com/): If I don't write something down, I'll forget it. As a developer, you learn so many new things every day, and technology keeps changing, it would be insane to want to keep it all in your head. So take notes, sync them to the cloud, and have them on all your devices. **(free)**

## 1password
[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword): Allows you to securely store your login and passwords. Even if you only use a few different passwords (they say you shouldn't!), this is really handy to keep track of all the accounts you sign up for! Also, they have a mobile app so you always have all your passwords with you (syncs with Dropbox). A little pricey though. There are free alternatives. **($50 for Mac app, $18 for iOS app)**

## Light Paper
[LightPaper](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/): As a developer, most of the stuff you write ends up being in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). In fact, this `README.md` file (possibly the most important file of a GitHub repo) is indeed in Markdown, written in Light Paper or Atom, and I use Light Paper to preview the results everytime I save. **(Free)**

## Atom
With the terminal, the text editor is a developer's most important tool. Everyone has their preferences, but unless you're a hardcore [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) user, a lot of people are going to tell you that [Atom](http://atom.io/) is currently the best free full featured one out there.

Go ahead and [download](https://atom.io/download/mac/) it. Open the **.zip** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder, you know the drill now. Launch the application.

**Note**: At this point I'm going to create a shorcut on the OS X Dock for Atom . To do so, right-click on the running application and select **Options > Keep in Dock**.
