Pressing the Mac power button in OS X Mavericks puts your Mac to sleep. A simple Terminal command can change it to display the shutdown dialog instead.

The Mac power button currently has three behaviours: sleep, shutdown dialog and force shutdown. Pressing the power button for about a second puts your Mac to sleep. Pressing it down for about three seconds brings up the shutdown dialog. If you prefer to disable the power buttonâ€™s sleep mode and have the shutdown dialog appear instead, open a Terminal window and enter the following command:

    defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool no

If you change your mind, you can switch it back with this command:

    defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool yes

Remember, you can also bring up the shutdown dialog with the Control-power button shortcut. If you have a Media Eject key, you can use the Control-Media Eject shortcut too.
