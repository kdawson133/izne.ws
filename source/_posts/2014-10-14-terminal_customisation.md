Most Terminal apps come with a set of colour customisation options, but they can be difficult to tweak yourself. If you want to make your own the web app [Terminal Sexy](http://terminal.sexy/) makes it a simple affair.

With [Terminal Sexy](http://terminal.sexy/) you can easily pick colours and change the look of your Terminal app with a colour slider. You can also browse other peopleâ€™s colour schemes, import themes and share your own.

The themes will work in any Terminal app that supports them, including XResources, Termite and iTerm 2.
