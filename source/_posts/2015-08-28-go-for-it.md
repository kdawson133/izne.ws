___Go For It!___ is a simple and stylish productivity utility. It features a to-do list that is merged with a timer that enables you to keeps your focus on the current task. I've already installed it and used it extensively, and I think it is brilliant. You should "give it a go" also!

Go For It's workflow is demonstrated in the following video:

## Storage and Synchronization

To-do lists are stored in the Todo.txt format. This simplifies synchronization with mobile devices and makes it possible to edit tasks using other front-ends.

If you already use Todo.txt, beware of the fact, that Go For It! automatically archives completed tasks to the done list!
